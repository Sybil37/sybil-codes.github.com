<h2 class="specs1" id="About"> About Me </h2>
<p> Hola! My name is Sybil and I am from Punjab. I study as well as tutor young children. My students are from different countries and teaching them is one of the things which I do and enjoy.  </p>
 <h2 class="specs1" id="RECODE"> Why I want to join RECODE </h2>
<p> Having a skill is a crucial thing. Individuals who are skilled at doing something , can ensure to support themselves and their families. And being skilled at web development is undoubtedly a very good skill to have in today's world, especially, if you are a member of the displaced community and are prohibited to work, as it helps you to earn an income from the comfort of your home. Also, it enables you to explore a set of different coding languages.</p>

 <p>  I wish to join this course because  I want to gain the skill of developing websites and at the same time do something that I like because when I first started learning programming, I enjoyed it immensely. I think of this course as an opportunity to delve deep into programming. </p>

<p>  In addition, I aspire to be a web-developer because I want to become a self-supporting and diverse individual in our technology-driven world, developing websites independently as well as being skilled at multiple programming languages. Moreover, I aspire to code a website for my tutoring classes from the knowledge I gain from this course, to create a platform for presenting my courses to parents who wish to tutor their children. </p>

<p> Besides that, I hope to start university in the future, where I am ambitious to continue my studies in a computer-related course. I believe that attending this workshop will not only help me gain a new, valuable skill but also be a great opportunity for me to explore different programming languages and gain an amazing learning experience.</p>
